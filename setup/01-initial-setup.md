- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Monitor (with HDMI port)
- Another computer (to flash)

# 2. Base Raspberry Pi Setup

Before we do anything with the more specialised hardware (e.g., AI Hat and Camera Module), we first need to get the Raspberry Pi working on its own.

1. On a separate computer, download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
2. Once downloaded, take the micro SD card and insert it into the SD card reader.
3. Plug the SD card reader into your separate compter.
4. Launch the Raspberry Pi imager and select the SD card volume (it should show the amount of memory available, which should be only a fraction less than the memory of the SD card you purchased)
5. In images, go to other/legacy operating systems and choose Bookworm 64-bit full. Do not select the type of Raspberry Pi you are using as this will prevent the selection of Bookworm. We need Bookworm as the AI Hat doesn't support Trixie yet.
6. Flash the operating system to the SD card and wait until it is completed.
7. Once flashed, remove the SD card from the reader and plug it into the Raspberry Pi 5 (Pi).
8. Plug the power supply and micro HDMI cable into the Pi.
9. Wait for the Pi to boot, and connect to the internet (via WiFi or Ethernet) and to your peripherals (mouse and keyboard via USB or via Bluetooth).

This completes our first vanilla boot of the Raspberry Pi. Next, we will focus on connecting the specialised hardware and getting those working.

# 3. Specialised Hardware Setup

Now that the Pi has been booted vanilla for the first time, we can now get the specialised hardware working.

**AI Hat**

1. Turn off the Pi by running `sudo poweroff` in the terminal.
2. Unplug the power supply and disconnect the micro HDMI cable (the next steps are a bit finicky, so it's better to have more freedom of movement with the Pi).
3. Plug the active cooler into the Pi by following the instructions included in the box. This involves aligning the cooler correctly, pushing in it's stabilising pins into the Pi board, and connecting the cable (yellow closest to edge of Pi).
4. Attach plastic spacers to the AI Hat to give it enough clearance off the Pi.
5. Attach extension GPIO headers to the Pi board to allow them to reach the AI Hat.
6. Push the AI Hat down so that the GPIO pins are flush (keep the PCIe ribbon out of the way, we will connect this next).
7. Connect the PCIe ribbon from the AI Hat to the Pi. Ensure you push the ribbon down evenly as you clamp the ribbon in place.
8. Tighten the spacers to secure the AI Hat to the Pi.

**Camera**

9. Run the adapter ribbon through the camera housing slit.
10. Connect the adapter ribbon to the camera module. The fat end goes into the camera, and the side with the circuit etchings visible is facing the same way as the side with the lens (i.e., you should be able to see the circuit lines and the camera lens). Ensure you push the ribbon down evenly as you clamp the ribbon in place.
11. Connect the adapter ribbon to the Pi. The side with the circuit etchings visible should be facing the USB ports. Ensure you push the ribbon down evenly as you clamp the ribbon in place.
12. Attach the camera housing to the swivel ball mount adapter.
13. Attach the swivel ball mount adapter to the tripod.

Now, we have all the specialised hardware connected to the Pi.

# 4. Specialised Software Setup

In this phase, we will check that all the hardware is connected properly and get it running.

1. First, ensure your Raspberry Pi OS is fully up-to-date.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

If a new kernel is installed, reboot your system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

2. Configure PCIe for Gen 3 Speed

    This is critical for getting full performance from the AI HAT.

	1. Run the Raspberry Pi configuration tool:
        ```bash
        sudo raspi-config
        ```
	2. Navigate to: `6 Advanced Options` â†’ `A8 PCIe Speed`.
	3. Select `Yes` to enable PCIe Gen 3 mode.
	4. Select `Finish` and choose to reboot.

3. Install Hailo Software Stack

After rebooting, install the complete Hailo driver, runtime, and tools.

```bash
sudo apt install hailo-all -y
```

Once the installation is complete, perform a full system update and reboot one more time to load the new driver and firmware.

```bash
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

4. Verify Installation

After the final reboot, verify that the system can see the Hailo chip.

**Check 1: PCIe Bus**

```bash
lspci | grep Hailo
```

You must see this output (or similar): `0001:01:00.0 Co-processor: Hailo Technologies Ltd. Hailo-8 AI Processor (rev 01)`

**Check 2: Hailo Runtime**

```bash
hailortcli fw-control identify
```

If successful, this will output the Firmware Version and Board Name, confirming both the software is installed and the hardware is communicating.

```bash
hailortcli scan
```

You must see a successful output, like:

```
Executing on device: 0001:01:00.0
...
Firmware Version: 4.20.0 (release,app,extended context switch buffer)
Board Name: Hailo-8
Device Architecture: HAILO8L
...
```

If both checks pass, your software is correctly installed and you can proceed.

5. Install and Run the Pose Estimation App

Clone the Hailo Applications repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps-infra.git
cd hailo-apps-infra
```

Run the application installer script
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

Set the display variable (if you are connecting remotely via SSH and need to see the video output)
```bash
export DISPLAY=:0
```

Run the pose detection application!
```bash
rpicam-hello -t 0 --post-process-file /usr/share/rpi-camera-assets/hailo_yolov8_pose.json
```
